# RGS (Random Group of Shaders)

These shaders were written for my second assignment in my Spring 2017 Computer Graphics course at Columbia University, COMS W4160.

The main program applies various shaders to the loaded Wavefront (OBJ) mesh. The following shaders are implemented; press each corresponding button to switch to the shader:

* 1=Sobel edge detection
* 2=Polka dots (meshes with textures (vt) only)
* 3=Phong shader
* 4=Basic shader (just a shader skeleton...)
* 5=Gouraud
* 6=Mip Map (Texture Modulation)
* 7=Checkerboard (meshes with textures (vt) only)
* 8=Normal Mapping
* 9=Cel (Cartoon)

This program was developed in Eclipse. JOML and pngj libraries included for convenience.

Here's video of the LWJGL program using the shaders-click on the link below to watch it. There are three shaders at work here: Sobel edge detection, Gouraud, and Cel (cartoon) shading.

(On a side note-do you recognize the song? It's all about the mesh!)
